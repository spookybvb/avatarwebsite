			  <h4>Learning Reflection</h4>
			  <p>What moments were you most proud of your efforts in this course? Why?</p>
			  <p>When I learned how to use CSS. I didn't know how to add the CSS to the HTML when learning how to make a website, so when I learned how to add it I was pretty proud of myself. Another thing I was proud of was when I made my first website which was the fictional character. For never making a website before I thought I did a pretty good job.<p>
			  
			  <p>Provide an example of a tough situation or barrier you handled well in this course and the key strengths you relied on.</p>
			  <p>Learning how to make a multiple page website. I had a hard time trying to add different pages to the website I forgot how to add them and had to look  it up which was not helpful at all so I had to figure it out myself. I did figure it out which made me feel so much better and less stressed. After that, the website was pretty easy to make.</p>
			  
			  <p>If you could do anything in this course over again, what, if anything, would you change?</p>
			  <p>I would love to do my bio website over again. I learned so many more things in scripting that I would love to add in my bio website like adding multiple pages instead of just having one page.</p>
			  
			  <p>What actions/behaviours should you start doing that would help you in future courses?</p>
			  <p>I should stop being afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something. And start talking to my classmates more so I can make some more friends.</p>
